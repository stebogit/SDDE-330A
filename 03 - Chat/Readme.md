> **Clean Architecture for a Chat Server:**
> Explain how you would design a chat server/application. It should be able to work on web-desktop/web-mobile/app-desktop/app-mobile.
> In particular, provide details about the various frontend and backend components, key classes and methods. You will
> have to list out and describe the key use cases, key components and the organization of those components in packages
> as well as architectural boundaries you are going to define. Please especially call out how your design conforms to 
> the "Clean Architecture" model discussed in the class.
> 
> _**Note:** Not all classes/methods/data structures are required. Only the most important ones from a design standpoint.
> Appropriate naming/signatures are enough._
